# ResearChain-SpaceWrap

### **Introduction**

The advancement of technology and the internet has revolutionized the way we conduct research and share information. However, the process of publishing research papers, filing for patents, and gaining recognition as an innovator remains a cumbersome task. This is primarily due to the need for funding, internal sources, and being a part of large organizations to be published. In addition, the existing systems are plagued by issues such as unsolicited email invitations, copyright infringement, and predatory journals.

To address these issues, we propose the creation of "ResearChain", a commercial social networking site for scientists and researchers to share papers, ask and answer questions, and find collaborators. ResearChain is a freely accessible web search engine that indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature across an array of publishing formats and disciplines. The ResearChain index includes peer-reviewed online academic journals and books, conference papers, theses and dissertations, preprints, abstracts, technical reports, and other scholarly literature, including court opinions and patents.

ResearChain aims to provide a platform that allows researchers to share their work, connect with other researchers, and access a wide range of scholarly literature. With ResearChain, researchers can take control of their own research journey and break free from the traditional and corrupt publishing system.

### Features

1. Acknowledgment of Talented Researchers: ResearChain provides a platform for researchers to showcase their work and gain recognition among top researchers in their field.
2. Grant Opportunities: Researchers can access grant opportunities to work on their projects and receive funding.
3. Collaboration and Hiring Opportunities: Researchers can connect with other researchers and find collaborators for their projects. Additionally, researchers can also be hired or offered collaborations based on their work.
4. Access to Established Organizations: Users can create new organizations and be part of established ones such as IEEE, ACM, and London-society of physics without spending a lot of money.
5. Security and Speed: ResearChain utilizes the Filecoin ecosystem for security and speed, ensuring that users' data is protected and accessible at all times.

### Conclusion

ResearChain aims to provide a platform for researchers to share their work, connect with other researchers, and access a wide range of scholarly literature. By breaking free from the traditional and corrupt publishing system, ResearChain allows researchers to take control of their own research journey and advance their careers. With its cutting-edge technology and user-friendly interface, ResearChain is poised to revolutionize the way we conduct research and share information.

### **How It's Made**

*Tell us about how you built this project; the nitty-gritty details. What technologies did you use? How are they pieced together? If you used sponsor technology how did it benefit your project? Did you do anything particuarly hacky that's notable and worth mentioning? How did you impress yourself which what your team built?*

The proposed "ResearChain" platform aims to revolutionize the traditional and often cumbersome process of publishing research papers and gaining recognition as an innovator in the academic community. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Filecoin, Lighthouse, Livepeer, Huddle, Push, and Spheron, ResearChain aims to provide a secure and accessible platform for researchers to share their work, connect with other researchers, and access a wide range of scholarly literature.

The ResearChain platform will leverage the Filecoin ecosystem to provide a secure and fast solution for storing and accessing the research papers and other scholarly literature indexed on the platform. This will ensure that the users' data is protected and accessible at all times.

Lighthouse will be used to provide a decentralized storage solution for the platform, ensuring that the data is immutable and cannot be altered. This will provide a secure and transparent solution for storing research papers and other scholarly literature.

Livepeer will be used to provide a decentralized video streaming solution for the platform. This will enable researchers to present their work in a visually engaging format, and provide an opportunity for collaboration and communication among researchers.

huddle will be used to provide a collaboration platform for researchers to connect with each other and find collaborators for their projects. This will provide researchers with the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and work together on projects.

Push will be used to provide a decentralized identity solution for the platform. This will enable researchers to create a secure and verifiable identity for themselves, and provide a secure and transparent solution for sharing their work.

Spheron will be used to provide a decentralized communication solution for the platform. This will enable researchers to communicate with each other in a secure and transparent manner and provide an opportunity for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

With its user-friendly interface and cutting-edge technology, ResearChain is poised to revolutionize the way we conduct research and share information. The platform provides researchers with the opportunity to take control of their own research journey, showcase their work, and advance their careers. Additionally, researchers can access grant opportunities, be part of established organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and London-Society of Physics, and connect with other researchers to find collaborators for their projects.

In conclusion, the ResearChain platform will provide a secure and accessible platform for researchers to share their work, connect with other researchers, and access a wide range of scholarly literature. By leveraging the power of cutting-edge technologies, ResearChain aims to revolutionize the traditional and often cumbersome process of publishing research papers and gaining recognition as an innovator in the academic community.
